# GarbagefreeCord (Fork of oldcord) 

I created this fork as I plan to fine-tune the theme and fix things up, I also was annoyed at the internal components utilizing assets from the GitHub repository even if used locally.

My plan *(for the future)* is to make the theme fully local and to modernize/fix some areas in which they are broken, such as the profile view.
I also want to revert the font as I've gotten used to the newer one and now this one is grating my eyes. 

(It'll be an option)

# Installation

## [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord) ***Works with BetterDiscord too***

#### Local method

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Aeyth8/Garbagefreecord/releases)
2. Unzip the folder and extract its contents into Vencord's theme folder

**You can open the themes folder directly from Discord (Vencord/BetterDiscord)'s menu.**
The usual path would be *%AppData%* -> Vencord\themes *(BetterDiscord\themes\)*
Linux would start in `~/.config` instead of AppData
